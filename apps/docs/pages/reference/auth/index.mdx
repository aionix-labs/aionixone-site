# Authorization Service

Enterprise-grade **ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)** system providing unified identity authentication and permission control across all AionixOne services.

> Formally specified. Adversarially verified. Production ready.

## Overview

The Auth service is the security foundation of AionixOne. Every API request passes through it. Every resource access is evaluated against policies. No exceptions.

```
Request → API Key Auth → Principal Extraction → Policy Evaluation → Allow / Deny
```

## Core Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **[Security Model](./model)** | Principals, Actions, and TRN resources |
| **[Policies](./policies)** | Policy schema and authorization rules |
| **[Guarantees](./guarantees)** | What the system guarantees |
| **[Verification](./verification)** | Adversarial test results |

## TRN Resources

```
trn:auth:{tenant}:key/{key_id}
trn:auth:{tenant}:policy/{policy_id}
```

## Quick Facts

- **Model**: ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)
- **Authentication**: API Key with SHA256 hashing
- **Principal Types**: `user`, `agent`, `system`
- **Actions**: 8 fine-grained action types
- **Multi-tenant**: Built-in workspace isolation
