# AionixOne

**The Control Plane for Local Execution**

AionixOne is a governance layer that brings order to scripts, functions, schedules, and automation running outside the cloud. It enforces one simple rule:

> **Anything that can execute must be governed.**

## Core Concepts

### TRN — Tenant Resource Name

Every object in AionixOne has a TRN. No TRN means it doesn't exist.

```
trn:{service}:{tenant}:{path}
```

- All objects must have a TRN
- All actions are TRN + Operation
- All executions generate a traceable record

### Six Integrated Services

| Service | Purpose | TRN Prefix |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **StepFlow** | Workflow orchestration | `trn:stepflow:` |
| **AionixFn** | Serverless functions | `trn:aionixfn:` |
| **Igniter** | Event triggers | `trn:igniter:` |
| **OpenAct** | External connectors | `trn:openact:` |
| **CredVault** | Secret management | `trn:credvault:` |
| **ParamStore** | Configuration parameters | `trn:paramstore:` |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Download and run
./aionix --port 53000

# Deploy a function
aio fn deploy my-func -f handler.py

# Create a workflow
aio wf create my-workflow --dsl workflow.json

# Run it
aio wf run my-workflow --data '{"key": "value"}'
```

## What You Get

- **Traceable** — Every execution has a source, context, and history
- **Governed** — Objects must be registered to exist
- **Transferable** — System state doesn't depend on human memory

## Deployment

Single binary. No cloud required. No agents. No rewriting your existing code.

```bash
# That's it
./aionix --port 53000
```
