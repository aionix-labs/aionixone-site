# Core Design Principles

The TRN spec enforces four principles so that automation, CLI tooling, and AI systems can reason about any resource without service-specific hacks.

## 1. Kind + Name = Identity

`path = {kind}/{name_path}` — declarative resources are uniquely identified by the combination of kind and name path.

| Component | Description | Examples |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `kind` | Resource type (with optional subtype) | `trigger/cron`, `workflow`, `credential/apiKey` |
| `name_path` | Resource name, optionally hierarchical | `daily-report`, `finance/weekly` |

```
trn:igniter:default:trigger/cron/finance/weekly
                    └─────────┴──────────────┘
                       kind      name_path
```

## 2. Kind Depth = Workspace Depth

Number of segments in `kind` must match the directory depth under the workspace.

| Kind | Depth | Workspace Path |
|------|-------|----------------|
| `trigger/cron` | 2 | `trigger/cron/...` |
| `workflow` | 1 | `workflow/...` |
| `credential/apiKey` | 2 | `credential/apiKey/...` |

This guards automatic discovery and prevents ambiguous folder structures.

## 3. TRN ⇄ Workspace ⇄ YAML Isomorphism

TRNs, directories, and YAML specs share the same structure:

| Dimension | Format | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| TRN | `trn:{service}:{tenant}:{kind}/{name}` | `trn:igniter:default:trigger/cron/daily` |
| Workspace | `{kind}/{name}/spec.yaml` | `trigger/cron/daily/spec.yaml` |
| YAML | `kind: {kind}` + `metadata.name: {name}` | `kind: trigger/cron` `name: daily` |

No manifest files are required; the shape alone reveals everything.

## 4. Kind Encodes Type Semantics

The `kind` field already includes type and subtype information—no extra `resource_type` field is needed.

```yaml
trigger/cron      # type=trigger, subtype=cron
action/http       # type=action, subtype=http
credential/apiKey # type=credential, subtype=apiKey
workflow          # type=workflow
action            # type=action (subtype in spec)
```

These principles keep AIonixOne resources predictable and machine-friendly.
