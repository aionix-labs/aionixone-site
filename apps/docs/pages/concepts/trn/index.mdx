# Tenant Resource Name (TRN)

The **Tenant Resource Name** is AIonixOne's platform-wide addressing scheme. It standardizes how workflows, functions, triggers, connectors, secrets, and parameters refer to each other while preserving tenant isolation.

- **Version:** 1.0
- **Status:** Stable
- **Last Update:** 2025-12-09
- **Authors:** AIonixOne Platform Team

## Why TRN exists

- Consistent resource naming across all services
- No manifest files or custom discovery logic—workspace paths, TRN strings, and YAML specs mirror each other
- Built-in tenant field and explicit kind/name semantics make automation and AI tooling reliable

## How to read this spec

- [Basic format](./format) — the raw syntax and constraints
- [Design principles](./principles) — why kind/name depth and isomorphism matter
- [Resource classes](./classification) — declarative vs runtime vs metadata
- [Operations](./operations) — extending TRNs for workflow DSLs
- [Service reference](./services) — per-service kinds and runtime entities
- [Implementation](./implementation) — parsing/building helpers, workspace rules
- [Versioning](./versioning) — stability guarantees and evolution policy
- [Appendices](./appendix) — comparisons and reference tables
