# Platform Specification

AionixOne is the control plane for local execution — a governance layer that unifies scripts, functions, schedules, and automation into a single, traceable system.

## The Rule

> **Anything that can execute must be governed.**

This is enforced through:

1. **TRN (Tenant Resource Name)** — Every object has a unique identifier
2. **Unified Operations** — All actions follow the same pattern: TRN + Operation
3. **Execution Records** — Every execution generates a traceable record

## Architecture

Single Rust binary bundling six integrated services:

| Service | Responsibility |
|---------|----------------|
| **StepFlow** | Workflow orchestration with JSON DSL |
| **AionixFn** | Serverless function execution (Python, Deno) |
| **Igniter** | Event triggers (cron, webhook, Kafka, etc.) |
| **OpenAct** | External connectors (databases, APIs, MCP) |
| **CredVault** | Encrypted secret management |
| **ParamStore** | Hierarchical configuration parameters |

## Deployment Model

- **Single binary** — No runtime dependencies
- **Embedded SQLite** — Instant, fully offline deployments
- **Unified API** — One surface for CLI, Studio, and VS Code

## Key Principles

### Everything Has a TRN

```
trn:<service>:<tenant>:<type>/<name>
```

No TRN means it doesn't exist in the system.

### Everything is Traceable

Every execution generates:
- Unique execution ID
- Input/output snapshots
- Step-by-step event log
- Duration and status

### Everything is Transferable

System state doesn't depend on:
- Human memory
- Excel spreadsheets
- Tribal knowledge
